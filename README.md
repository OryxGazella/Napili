Napili - Turtle Graphics with Groovy
==============================

Napili is a simple Turtle Graphics Program with Groovy as the user facing programming language.   Users can control
the turtle using a small set of commands, along with all the libraries that Java and Groovy have to offer.

From the Napili Help:


home - send the turtle to it's home position, without drawing any
    lines
pencolor - change the color used by the turtle to draw lines.
    Takes javafx.scene.paint.Color as an argument.
penup - puts the turtle's pen in the up position - movement won't
    result in drawing a line.
pendown - puts the turtle's pen in the down position - movement
    results in drawing a line.
left - turns the turtle left, takes a numeric argument as a number
    of degrees (360 results in turning the turtle in a full circle
    counterclockwise)
right - turns the turtle right, takes a numeric argument as a
    number of degrees. (360 results in turning the turtle in a full
    circle clockwise)
forward - move the turtle forward, takes an argument that is the
    number of steps to move
back - move the turtle backward, takes an argument that is the number
    of steps to move
show - show the turtle
hide - hide the turtle (it's still there, and will still draw, you
    just can't see it)
speed - the speed that the turtle draws.  Takes one numeric argument,
    higher is faster



To make Napili (insert instructions here - ant from the commandline should work once you've got the libraries set up).


Napili's code comes with IntelliJ IDEA and Netbeans setups.


I created Napili as a way to learn JavaFX (as well as a number of other technologies), and to better explain Groovy
DSLs on my blog (which can be found at http://jamesgdriscoll.wordpress.com )

Napili is named after the beautiful bay off the coast of Maui, where I once saw a turtle the size of a Volkswagen.
